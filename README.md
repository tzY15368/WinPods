# WinPods
 Airpods battery viewer for Windows 10
 Tested and developed on Dell AC1560 and Intel AX200(music stutters occur occasionally, no current fix)), Windows 10, version 18362.720
## Requirements 
- Windows 10, version 16299 (Fall Creators Update) or higher
- Bluetooth 4.0+ 
## References 
- Inspiration from Android project:<https://github.com/adolfintel/OpenPods>
- Using Python library "Bleak":<https://github.com/hbldh/bleak> and "pybluez"
## Todo
- improve icon in app and tray, unify styles.
- language localization(if needed)
- see if we could modify the way buttons on airpods work, this would probably require some reverse engineering, so I'm not expecting to finish it soon.
## Longterm
- rewrite the whole app in c++ or c#(I doubt if this could improve overall performance, as latency mainly exists in device detection)
## Known bugs
## Known Issues
- huge packing size(exe)
- slow startup time(exe)
